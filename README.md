# Fusion ART Retrieval Model by Patrick Tjahjadi

## Aim
The aim of this project is to store and retrieve data from a Fusion Adaptive Resonance Theory
(ART) model, given a dataset. The foundation of the Fusion ART model is done using various machine learning methodologies:
* Binary encoding
* Word Embedding
* Dynamic Word Embedding / Language Model

The accuracy of the model in retrieving data can then be measured for varying levels of noise.

## Folders
* Code: Contains the code, text corpora and dataset to develop the Fusion ART model. Also contains the results of the queries for this experiment.
* Figures: Contains all visualisations for this experiment.
* Literatures: Contains some research papers that were used for this experiment.
* Preliminary_code: Contains foundational basic and schema-based Fusion ART models without requiring datasets. Developed by Dr. Budhitama Subagdja.
* Reports: Contains research articles and reports for this experiment. 


## Applications
We can retrieve the accuracy of the Fusion ART model in querying research keywords for varying levels of noise.
The model parameters affect the retrieval accuracy.

By modifying the pre-processing and querying process to account for different variables,
this model can be used for a variety of datasets.
